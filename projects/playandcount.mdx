 At Advaita Garden’s Elementary School the kids made felt balls. There was much curiosity, excitement, lots of soapy water and raw wool, creating delightful chaos. We began making a ball adding soapy water slowly while singing together to harmonize our hand movements, covering some of the tiny hands in soapy bubbles. Kids were enjoying working independently and left with super clean hands! Certainly a win-win situation for all. After placing the balls to dry, we discussed with the teachers ways to use these balls for play and counting.
